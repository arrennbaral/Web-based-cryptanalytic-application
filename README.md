# Web-based-cryptanalytic-application
The project allows users to encrypt or decrypt using substitution cipher or XOR cipher.
 Users need to sign up to access the application from the page signup.php. Once signed up, user information is saved into the database. Users can log in using their credentials from the page userlogin.php. If the credentials do not match the information in the database, it will redirect to userlogin.php. Once successfully logged in, the application provides the user to enter a key and upload text file. 
Also, the user has the choice to select a method to encrypt or decrypt; substitution or XOR
Once the information is filled up, now the user can click the encrypt or decrypt button.
All of the user contents are carefully sanitized to prevent any kind of attack.
